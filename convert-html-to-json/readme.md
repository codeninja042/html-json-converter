## Package Versioning

It's essential to manage package versions properly. You can use semantic versioning (SemVer) to version your package. Update the `version` field in your `package.json` file accordingly before each release.

## Publishing Your Package

Once your package is ready, follow these steps to publish it to the npm registry:

1. Log in to your npm account if you haven't already:

   ```shell
   npm login
   ```

   Enter your npm username, password, and email address when prompted.

2. Navigate to your package's root directory in the terminal.

3. Run the following command to publish your package to the npm registry:

   ```shell
   npm publish
   ```

   This will package your module and make it publicly available on the npm registry.

4. Confirm that your package has been published successfully by visiting its npm page, which will be in the format:

   ```
   https://www.npmjs.com/package/convert-html-to-json
   ```

   Replace `convert-html-to-json` with the actual name of your package.

## Updating Your Package

When you make updates to your package, you should increase the version number in your `package.json` file and publish a new version using the `npm publish` command.

## Conclusion

By following these steps, you can register your custom Node.js package on the npm registry, making it available for others to install and use in their projects.

For more information on npm and package publishing, refer to the official npm documentation: [npm Documentation](https://docs.npmjs.com/).

If you encounter any issues or have questions about publishing your package, you can seek help from the npm community or npm support.

Happy packaging!
